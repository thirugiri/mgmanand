				a mistake it is better to speak it out and find a solution that to be silent on the
				matter.</h3>

				accurately, even in the days of no barcode and software based systems.
				He returned to Chennai after 7 years and took the declining resort business. With
				his patience and experience, he concentrates on providing the best service. He
				enhanced the Chinese food restaurant in the resort by offering beach extensions
				and named it as service on the beach. He prioritizes his employees and customer
				satisfaction; he knows that for a business to flourish, contentment of its employees
				is important. As expected, by the year 2000 the resort business started to flourish
				and the customer satisfaction was surpassing.

				hard work is the reason for his success. He firmly believes that a positive work
				culture is vital for the organization to sustain. With a renewed way of thinking he
