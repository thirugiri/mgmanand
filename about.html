				database to collect and process report; long before modern software enabled
				systems are created. His efficient changes brought the company significant success.

				down with around 500 vehicles including trucks, excavators and Dozers. MGM

				Although he is a great business man who has been running business profitably for
				years he too faced failure. He failed in the granite business he started. This failure

				helped him to take his other decisions carefully. He believed that when we commit
				a mistake it is better to speak it out and find a solution that to be silent on the
				matter.</h3>

				the importance of time management and connecting with people. He worked hard
				with his employees and inspects the truck personally. He instituted rigorous
				reporting mechanism. This helps to monitor the profitability of each truck
				accurately, even in the days of no barcode and software based systems.
				He returned to Chennai after 7 years and took the declining resort business. With
				his patience and experience, he concentrates on providing the best service. He
				enhanced the Chinese food restaurant in the resort by offering beach extensions
				and named it as service on the beach. He prioritizes his employees and customer
				satisfaction; he knows that for a business to flourish, contentment of its employees
				is important. As expected, by the year 2000 the resort business started to flourish
				and the customer satisfaction was surpassing.

				spite of failures bring success. MGM Anand is a living example of that, incessant
				hard work is the reason for his success. He firmly believes that a positive work
				culture is vital for the organization to sustain. With a renewed way of thinking he
				focused on the requisite of the client and superior customer service. As a result the
				MGM Group went through a drastic advancement ubiquitously, by establishing
				strong business partnerships globally.</h3>
